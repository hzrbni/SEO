                        Google’s search algorithm is very complex, changes frequently, and is not completely known to
                        the public.</small>

                    <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the strictest sense, keyword or key phrase research isn’t a success factor as much as it is a
                        prerequisite. Before you worry about whether your website is optimized, you first need to know
                        what you’d like it to be optimized for. The initial step in ranking or prioritizing keywords or
                        phrases is to understand how your target audience searches for your products or services. Once
                        you do some basic research related to how and how often your audience uses various search terms,
                        you can then prioritize terms you’d like your website to show up for in search engine results.
                        Once you know what you are targeting, you can then start to worry about how to optimize your
                        site for those terms.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12">
                    <h3>on-site optimization</h3>
                    <p>
                        A simple way to understand factors that impact how well your website is optimized, is to
                        consider tactics that are done on or are a part of your website vs. tactics that occur somewhere
                        else (off-site optimization). In my opinion, on-site or on-page SEO factors can have the
                        greatest impact for most small organizations, and should be your first priority. If you haven’t
                        done the basic on-site tactics well, off-site strategies will have less impact. While there are
                        many, many components to successful on-site optimization, I’ll break them down into four main
                        success factors:
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row no-margin">
                <div class="col s12 m6 card-item">
                    <img class="card-icon" src="img/content.png" width="250" alt="Link Building">
                    <h4><mark>Content and Content Architecture</mark></h4>
                    <p>Everything starts with content when it comes to website effectiveness, and that includes SEO.
                        Does your site provide relevant, useful content related to the search terms you are targeting?
                        Is your sitemap structured to easily find content and does it include pages/content related to
                        all your prioritized keywords and phrases? Those are the basics and where you should start.
                        Remember, the objective of the search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.) is to provide the most
                        relevant websites (with the best content) for what people are searching for. That is how they
                        make their money.</p>

                    <img class="card-icon" src="img/foundational-elements.png" width="250"

                    <h4><mark>
                            Foundational Elements & Best Practices</mark></h4>
                    <p>This area is critical for any organization designing and developing a new website, as you’ll need
                        to make sure your digital marketing agency or website development firm understands website
                        optimization and includes SEO implementation in your budget. Unfortunately, I’ve reviewed many a
                        website that looks nice, but was designed without any consideration of driving traffic and
                        leads. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h4><mark>Mobile-friendly</mark></h4>
                    <p>This could have been included under foundational elements, but in my opinion is important enough
                        to list as a separate success factor. Roughly 50% of website browsing is now done on mobile
                        devices (phones, watches, tablets, etc.), so it is critical for usability, engagement, and
                        conversions, as well as website optimization that your site is mobile-friendly. In early 2015,
                        Google officially started penalizing non-mobile sites in their ranking algorithm, pushing web
                        browsers towards sites that are easier to navigate and engage with.</p>

                    <h4><mark>Content Marketing</mark></h4>
                    <p>Website and digital marketing strategy, means that you should focus on your long-term content
                        marketing plan, thinking through how your website can become your marketing engine and also
                        determining what type of content works best for you. Websites that are updated frequently and
                        provide new, relevant content will be viewed as
                        experts in their field by both site visitors and search engines alike. The message should always
                        be that strong content adds credibility to your organization and also drives enhanced search
                        results – they go hand in hand. And as I mentioned above, make sure you have a content
                        management solution that is both functional and easy to use, so that non-technical business
                        people can easily market and update your site.</p>

                    <h3>Off-Site Optimization</h3>
                    <p>
                        Off-site (or off-page) optimization refers to all the strategies or tactics that are executed
                        somewhere besides your own website, but that positively impact your website’s search engine
                        rankings. As I mentioned above, I’d suggest first getting your on-site ducks in a row, as that
                        foundation will support better results for your off-page efforts. Once you have that baseline
                        established off-site tactics can help take your site to the next level.

                    <h4><mark>Links to Your Website</mark></h4>
                    <p>A simple way to think about links to your website is that each link from a reputable and relevant
                        (for your keyword targets) site is like a vote for your site to show up higher on search results
                        pages. But in this case, all votes are not equal. A link from a higher authority, trusted
                        website is worth more than a link from a site that only has a few followers. So if my website
                        sells Indianapolis Colts t-shirts, I’d much rather have NFL.com link to my site than
                        FredsFootballMania.com. It is also beneficial that links or anchor text to your site include
                        keywords you are targeting, as those keywords in the anchor text are an indicator to search
                        engines as to the topic of the page being linked to. See below for examples of good and bad
                        anchor text links.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4><mark>Social Marketing</mark></h4>
                    <p>Social Marketing initiatives support search engine optimization objectives in a number of ways.
                        First, social sites provide relevant, although not always reputable and authoritative, links to
                        your website, which as I mentioned above is beneficial. Second, social sites are a perfect place
                        to post content from your website or new content that relates to your site. Your followers can
                        then share that content, creating greater visibility and additional links back to your site.
                        Finally, search engines are now tracking social influence for its own sake, not just for the
                        link value. Organizations with significant social followings, social shares, likes, etc. will
                        positively impact SEO results. Additionally, if respected influencers on social media (with a
                        solid reputation) share your content, it will also benefit your site optimization.</p>
